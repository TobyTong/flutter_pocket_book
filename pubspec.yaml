publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - asset/images/
    - asset/images/ic_mine_message.png
    - asset/images/ic_mine_setting.png
    - asset/images/ic_me_service.png
    - asset/images/ic_me_vip.png
    - asset/images/ic_skin_home_bill.png
    - asset/images/ic_skin_home_bill_pressed.png
    - asset/images/ic_skin_home_chart.png
    - asset/images/ic_skin_home_chart_pressed.png
    - asset/images/ic_skin_home_me.png
    - asset/images/ic_skin_home_me_pressed.png
    - asset/images/ic_skin_home_property.png
    - asset/images/ic_skin_home_property_pressed.png
    - asset/images/ic_vip_default_avatar.png
    - asset/images/ic_me_yd_tab_ad.png
    - asset/images/icon_fuli.png
    - asset/images/icon_gongju.png
    - asset/images/icon_kefu.png
    - asset/images/icon_vip.png
    - asset/images/account_banner.jpg
#     - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
